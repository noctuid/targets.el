TO-TYPE is one of pair, quote, separator, or object. OPEN and CLOSE should be
strings. CLOSE is only used for pair text objects. LINEWISE is only used for
object type text objects.

LET can be specified as a list of bindings (just like the first argument to
`let') to locally bind variables in each of the created text objects.

If BIND is non-nil, additionally bind all of the created text objects.
INNER-KEY, A-KEY, INSIDE-KEY, and AROUND-KEY can be changed to alter the prefix
keys used for the corresponding text object types. NEXT-KEY, LAST-KEY, and
REMOTE-KEY can be changed to alter the intermediate keys used for next, last,
and remote text objects. If any of these are nil, the corresponding text objects
will not be bound at all. IF KEYS is not specified, it will default to OPEN and
CLOSE. If TO-TYPE is object or OPEN or CLOSE are regexps/multiple
characters (for TO-TYPE pair or separator), KEYS must be explicitly specified if
BIND is non-nil. MORE-KEYS can be used to specify keys to be used in addtion to
OPEN/CLOSE. Both KEYS and MORE-KEYS can be a single key or a list of keys.

If HOOKS is non-nil, add functions to locally bind the keys to the specified
hooks instead of binding the keys globally. HOOKS can be either a single hook or
