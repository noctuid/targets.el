#+STARTUP: overview
* About
This package is like a combination of the targets, TextObjectify, anyblock, and expand-region vim plugins.

Please note that this package is in an early stage of development. This package is not yet polished, and much of the planned functionality is not yet implemented.

* Differences from =targets.vim=
- Pairs can be regexps
- No N or L (see rationale below)
- Adds "remote" text objects (selected with [[https://github.com/abo-abo/avy][avy]])
- Objects are supported (e.g. =danw=; this is a todo item for targets.vim)
- Currently no support for tag text objects and no argument text object
- Not polished (please make issues)

* Types of Text Objects
Targets.vim specifies three kinds of text objects. This package adds another three to that list:

- pair (created using ~evil-select-paren~)
- quote (created using ~evil-select-quote~)
- separator (created using ~evil-select-paren~)
+ object (created with ~evil-select-*-object~; uses thing-at-point)
+ composite (a combination of any number of the above)
+ simple (e.g. created using ~evil-range~; extra =n=, =l=, etc. text objects not supported; not yet implemented)

** Pair
A pair consists of an opening and closing delimiter that are different from each other. Each can be a single character or a regexp.

** Quote
A quote consists of an opening and closing delimiter that are the same. The delimiter must be a single character. Unlike with evil's default quote text objects, =a= will not select any surrounding whitespace (this functionality is moved to =A=). There is an option to keep the default behavior (not yet implemented).

** Separator
The main difference between a separator and a quote is that there do not need to be a balanced number of separators. A separator delimiter can be a regexp. =a= also behaves slightly differently. It includes the first separator but not the second, so that after a deletion, a separator will still be left in between the text on either side.

** Objects/Things
These are text objects that use =thingatpt.el= such as =evil-word= and =evil-sentence=. Since =i= and =a= already act as =I= and =A= by default, no =I= or =A= text objects are created.

** Miscellaneous/Simple
Since this package is about adding extra text objects, it also adds a few other specific text objects that evil does not have by default:

- line (not yet implemented)
- buffer (not yet implemented)
- argument (as a regexp pair; not yet implemented)

** i, a, I, A, l, n, r
In addition to the standard inner and outer text objects, the =targets.vim= plugin adds =[I]nside= and =[A]round=. In this package, these act how =i= and =a= do for objects (such as =evil-word=) except they are for the pair, quote, and separator types. =I= will select inside the delimiters excluding any whitespace, and =A= will select all the text encompassed by the delimiters, the delimiters, and either trailing or leading whitespace. Trailing whitespace is preferred.

=[n]ext= and =[l]ast= text objects are also added. These will select the next and previous text object and can take a count. For example, =vin(= would select the next parens, and =v2in(= would select the parens after those. When used with a non-selection operator (such as delete), the point will not be moved.

The =targets.vim= plugin also has =N= and =L= (which act as =n= and =l= with a doubled count). These do not exist for quotes since seeking behavior is intelligent in this package (a proper quote will always be selected). They do not exist for separators because it is easy to double your count if you wish to.

Finally, there is a =[r]emote= text object. This allows you to select the text object to act on using avy. ~avy-resume~ is supported but will only move the point to the corresponding text object. ~evil-repeat~ can be used to repeat the action as well. For example, with [[https://github.com/Dewdrops/evil-exchange][evil-exchange]], =g x a s <avy-keys> . <avy-keys>= could be used to swap two sentences remotely.

Note that the keys used for these can be customized.

* Additions to Evil's Functionality
Unlike in vim, evil already implements some of the features added in the aforementioned vim plugins. Evil's quote text objects can cover multiple lines, and paren text objects will seek forward if defined with strings instead of characters (like in =TextObjectify=). Evil's quote text objects are smart and will only select within a proper quote (and not the space in between quoted text; like in =targets=). Evil's text objects also support counts and expanding a selection when called again (like =targets= and =expand-region=). Adding composite text objects (like =anyblock= has) allows for expanding a region to fill the next of any number of text objects.

** Seeking
By default, =i(=, for example, will not seek forward. ~evil-inner-paren~ can be redefined to seek forward by using strings instead of characters for the open and close paren, but the behavior will not always be as intelligent. This is because ~evil-up-block~ (~evil-up-paren~ is used for the default paren text objects) does not consider whether delimiters are escaped or whether they are in the same string or comment. Evil also does not have backward seeking.

Instead of attempting to add more types of seeking to every evil selection function directly, this package just ignores the default seeking. If there is no text object at the point, this package will try the functions in =targets-seek-functions= in order in an attempt to find a text object. Like in =targets.vim=, seeking is customizable (by changing the functions in =targets-seek-functions=). By default, every text object defined with this package will seek first forward and then backward.

If you want to create a new seeking function, you can look at the functions in =targets-seek-functions= and at the arguments they take. It is more likely that you will only want to make slight changes to the seeking behavior. For example, if you don't want backward seeking, you can remove that function from the list. If you don't want any seeking, you can set the list to =nil=. By default, seeking is bounded to the text visible in the window. To alter the bounds, the =targets-bound= variable can changed to specify a user-created function. See the default function's docstring for information on how a user-created function should behave.

** Jump List
Like in =targets.vim=, you can also customize when seeking causes a new entry to be added to the jump list. To do this, you can change the =targets-push-jump-p= variable to specify a different function. See the default function's docstring for more information. By default, a new entry is added when seeking moves the point to a different line.

* Text Object Creation
This package provides three main macros for creating text objects.

** ~targets-define-to~
This is the main way provided by this package for creating text objects in bulk.

Here is a basic example with all the required arguments:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(targets-define-to paren "(" ")" pair)
#+end_src
This will result in the creation of 16 text objects (=inner=, =a=, =inside=, =around=, and the next, last, and remote versions of these).

The first argument is a symbol that will be used when naming the new text objects. The next two arguments specify the delimiters for the text objects. The fourth arguments specifies the type of the text objects. The names for the types are =pair=, =quote=, =separator=, and =object=. Only =pair= will use the closing delimiter. The opening delimiter should always be a string except for an =object=, for which it should be the symbol corresponding to the thing.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(targets-define-to double-quote "\"" nil quote)
(targets-define-to comma "," nil separator)
(targets-define-to word 'evil-word nil object)
#+end_src

~targets-define-to~ accepts additional keyword arguments. Specifying =bind= as non-nil will also bind the created text objects. By default, text objects are bound to the opening delimiter (and closing delimiter for pairs, e.g =i(=, =i)=, =a(=, =a)=, etc.). If the delimiters are regexps or the type is =object=, =:keys= must be explicitly specified. =:keys= completely replaces the default keys, and =:more-keys= adds to them. Both can be either a single key or a list of keys. =:inner-key=, =:a-key=, =:inside-key=, =:around-key=, =:next-key=, =:last-key=, and =:remote-key= can also be specified to change the intermediate keys used from their defaults. If any of them is set to =nil=, the corresponding text objects will not be bound.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(targets-define-to paren "(" ")" pair
                   :bind t :more-keys "r" :last-key "p" :remote-key nil)
(targets-define-to word 'evil-word nil object :bind t :keys "w")
#+end_src

Evil does not support defining mode-local text objects with ~evil-define-key~ (e.g. binding =iw= in the operator and visual states will not override the default =iw=). Buffer-local text objects do work though, so ~targets-define-to~ provides the =:hooks= keyword argument to specify hooks to be used to locally bind the defined text objects (instead of binding them globally). The argument can be a list (e.g. =:hook (emacs-lisp-mode-hook lisp-mode-hook)=) or a single hook (e.g =:hooks emacs-lisp-mode-hook=). Note that the name specified should be unique from any other targets text object names (e.g. =elisp-quote= if =quote= already exists).

The =:let= keyword is also provided to allow locally defining variables for the created text objects. See [[#text-object-specific-settings][Text Object Specific Settings]] for more information

** ~targets-define-composite-to~
Composite objects are composed of multiple regular text objects. Whichever text object gives the smallest selection that includes the current selection or point will be used. If there are no text objects around the current selection or at the point, composite text objects will still seek (if ~targets-seek-functions~ is non-nil). When seeking, the closest text object is favored. Counts still work to expand the selection multiple times (e.g. =d2id=).

Here is an example of defining composite text objects that will act on any of the default pair delimiters:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(targets-define-composite-to pair-delimiter
  (("(" ")" pair)
   ("[" "]" pair)
   ("{" "}" pair)
   ("<" ">" pair))
  :bind t
  :next-key nil
  :last-key nil
  :keys "d")
#+end_src

~targets-define-composite-to~ has the same keyword arguments as ~targets-define-to~ except there is no =:more-keys=. If =:bind= is specified as non-nil, =:keys= must also be specified.

** ~targets-define-simple-to~
Not yet implemented.

* Specific Provided Text Objects
** ~targets-last-text-object~
This command will run the the last text object used in the current state (operator or visual). For operator state, it may be useful if you want to use a different operator with the previous text object (otherwise you could just use ~evil-repeat~). It is probably more useful for visual state where it can be used as a shorter key to expand the region. The last text object for visual state resets in between visual selections. You can set =targets-default-text-object= to a default text object to use the first time ~targets-last-text-object~ is run after visual state is entered.

~targets-last-text-object~ is unbound by default; I personally bind it to =RET=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key evil-visual-state-map (kbd "RET") #'targets-last-text-object)
(define-key evil-operator-state-map (kbd "RET") #'targets-last-text-object)
#+end_src
* Configuration
~targets-setup~ can be used to create and optionally bind all the text objects specified in =targets-text-objects=, =targets-user-text-objects=, and =targets-composite-text-objects=. Each is a list of lists of arguments to be passed to ~targets-define-to~ (or ~targets-define-composite-to~ in the case of =targets-composite-text-objects=). Entries in =targets-user-text-objects= that have the same name as a default text object in =targets-text-objects= are given precedence. This allows easily overriding any of the default text objects. There are no default composite text objects.

Please note that if you do not use ~targets-setup~, you will need to add ~(add-hook 'post-command-hook #'targets--reset-position)~ to your configuration to have next, last, and remote text objects keep the cursor position.

When run without any arguments, ~targets-setup~ will only create the text objects. It takes an optional, positional argument that specifies whether text objects should also be bound to keys. Keyword arguments can be used to customize the keys used in the bindings. =:inside-key= and =:around-key= determine what keys are bound to =targets-inside-text-objects-map= and =targets-around-text-objects-map= in the visual and operator states. They default to =I= and =A= respectively. If they are not changed from their defaults, they will be bound in a way such that =I= and =A= will continue to work as normal with a visual block selection.

=inner-key=, =a-key=, =:next-key=, =:last-key=, and =:remote-key= can also be specified; they will be passed to ~targets-define-to~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(targets-setup t :last-key "L" :around-key (kbd "C-a"))
;; don't bind remote text objects
(targets-setup t :remote-key nil)
#+end_src

Note that all of the =*-key= keywords and =:bind= can be overridden for an individual entry in =targets-text-objects= or =targets-user-text-objects=. =targets-text-objects= is composed of =targets-pair-text-objects=, =targets-quote-text-objects=, =targets-separator-text-objects=, and =targets-object-text-objects=. If you would like to completely modify the default text objects, you can also set any of these before loading targets.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq targets-quote-text-objects
  '((single-quote "'" nil quote :next-key "N")
    (double-quote "\"" nil quote :last-key "L")
    (smart-single-quote "‘" "’" quote :bind nil)
    ...))
#+end_src

After targets has loaded, you can still add items to and remove items from =targets-text-objects=, =targets-user-text-objects=, and =targets-composite-text-objects= before running ~targets-setup~.

** Example Use-package Setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package targets
    :load-path "path/to/targets.el"
    :init
    (setq targets-user-text-objects '((pipe "|" nil separator)
                                      (paren "(" ")" pair :more-keys "b")
                                      (bracket "[" "]" pair :more-keys "r")
                                      (curly "{" "}" pair :more-keys "c")))
    :config
    (targets-setup t
                   :inside-key nil
                   :around-key nil
                   :remote-key nil))
#+end_src
* Settings
** Text Object Specific Settings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: text-object-specific-settings
:END:

The =:let= keyword can be used to locally bind certain variables for all the text objects created by a single ~targets-define-to~ or ~targets-define-composite-to~ statement:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(targets-define-to paren "(" ")" pair
                   :let ((targets-bound #'my-targets-paren-bound)))
#+end_src

** Avy Settings
For remote text objects, this package provides =targets-avy-style=, =targets-avy-keys=, =targets-avy-background=, =targets-avy-all-windows=, and =targets-avy-all-windows-alt=. All will override the corresponding avy settings when specified. When the first two are set to =nil= and the last three are set to the symbol =use-avy=, the corresponding avy setting will be used. Note that you can also use =avy-keys-alist= and =avy-styles-alist= for customizing the behavior of specific text objects.

Although =targets-avy-all-windows= and =targets-avy-all-windows-alt= exist, changing them is not recommended. Using remote text objects with more than one window is not fully supported (and not all that useful). While it will work to create a visual selection, it will not work with other operators unless the other window is for the same buffer. I have not found a way around this at the moment.
